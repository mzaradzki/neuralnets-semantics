# neuralnets-semantics

This repo is implementing Word representation as feature vectors in :

* Python (plain)
* Python with Theano
* Python with TensorFlow


The model is based on a neural network that is trained on predicting the last word in a 4-gram.
The plain Python version is based on Octave code from G Hinton.
