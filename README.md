# neuralnets-semantics

This repo is implementing Word representation as feature vectors in :

* Python with numpy - DONE
* Python with Theano - in progress
* Python with TensorFlow - in progress
* Python with PyTorch - to do


The model is based on a neural network that is trained on predicting the last word in a 4-gram.
The plain Python version is based on Octave code from G Hinton.
