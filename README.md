# neuralnets-semantics

This repo is implementing Word representation as feature vectors in :

* Python with numpy - DONE
* Python with Theano - DONE (but need some clean-up)
* Python with TensorFlow - DONE (but need some clean-up)
* Python with PyTorch - to do


The model is based on a neural network that is trained on predicting the last word in a 4-gram.
The plain Python version is based on Octave code from G Hinton.
